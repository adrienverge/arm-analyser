 * @section DESCRIPTION
 *
 * This file gives structures and function to manipulate intervals and groups
 * of intervals. You can add intervals, like this:
 *   [0-10] [20-30] [100-999]
 * When you add an interval (for instance [20-30], it is automatically placed
 * at the right place, by increasing order. It is also automatically merged
 * with other intervals if needed. For example, if you add [9-20] to the
 * previous example, you get the following group of intervals:
 *   [0-30] [100-999]
 * When a group of intervals is set up, you can test if a value is within one
 * of these intervals by calling group_in_group().
